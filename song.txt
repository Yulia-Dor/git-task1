A gloomy day is brighter from a smile,
From a smile in the sky, the rainbow will wake up
Share your smile
And she will come back to you more than once!

And then the clouds will surely suddenly dance
And the grasshopper starts playing the violin!
A river begins from a blue stream
Well, friendship begins with a smile,
A river begins from a blue stream
Well, friendship begins with a smile!
