A gloomy day is brighter from a smile,
From a smile in the sky, the rainbow will wake up
Share your smile
And she will come back to you more than once!


From the smile of the sunny one
The saddest rain will stop crying
Sleepy forest will say goodbye to silence
And clapping his green hands!

And then the clouds will surely suddenly dance
And the grasshopper starts playing the violin!
A river begins from a blue stream
Well, friendship begins with a smile,
A river begins from a blue stream
Well, friendship begins with a smile!
